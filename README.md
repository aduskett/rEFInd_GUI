# rEFInd_GUI
A graphical setup and customization utility to use alongside rEFInd

Upload of files and updating README is a work in progress.

This is basically a variation of my [SteamDeck_rEFInd](https://github.com/jlobue10/SteamDeck_rEFInd) repo with various improvements including generic username support, support for multiple Linux distros and installing the config file, icons and background PNGs without needing to type the `sudo` password.

More coming soon...
